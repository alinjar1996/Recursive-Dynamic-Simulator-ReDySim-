# Recursive-Dynamic-Simulator-ReDySim-
Recursive Dynamic Simulator (ReDySim) is a Graphical User Interface, developed in MATLAB. It is used for simulation and control of open and closed-loop robotic or multibody systems.
It is a MATLAB-based recursive solver for dynamic analysis of robotic and multibody systems. It essentially consist of very efficient recursive inverse and forward dynamics algorithms for simulation and control of open and closed-loop multibody systems. ReDySim delves upon the concept of Decoupled Natural Orthogonal Complement (DeNOC) based approach for dynamic modeling. In comparison to commercially available software, dynamic analyses in ReDySim can be performed without creating solid model. ReDySim showed considerable improvement over commercial software such as ADAMS, RecurDyn and algorithms available in literature in terms of the computational time and numerical accuracy. The algorithms in ReDySim have also been used in RoboAnalyzer, a 3D model based software for robot simulation, developed in Mechanical Engineering Department at IIT Delhi.
